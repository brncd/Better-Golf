# Better Golf

Welcome to the Better Golf application, a comprehensive system designed to streamline the management of golf tournaments, including player registration, tournament creation, category management, course setup, scorecard tracking, and result analysis.

>This application was developed primarily for learning purposes and is not intended for real-world deployment. It serves as a demonstration of various development concepts and techniques rather than being a production-ready project. Please note that this repository is solely intended for educational and developmental use, and caution should be exercised if considering any production-level implementation based on this codebase.


## Project Overview

The Better Golf aplication consists of two main components: the **API** (server-side) and the **Client** (front-end).

### API

The API serves as the back-end of the application, responsible for handling data storage, retrieval, and business logic. It provides a set of endpoints to manage various aspects of golf tournaments:

- **Players**: Register players, update player information, and associate players with tournaments.

- **Tournaments**: Create and manage golf tournaments, add players and categories to tournaments, and track scorecards.

- **Categories**: Set up tournament categories, including open, ladies, and age-based categories.

- **Courses**: Manage golf courses, add holes, and assign courses to specific categories.

- **Holes**: Define individual holes on golf courses, including par and distance information.

- **Scorecards**: Record and manage scorecards for tournament rounds, including hole-by-hole scores.

- **Results**: Analyze tournament results, calculate scores, and determine winners in various categories.

### Client

The Client component is the user interface for the Better Golf aplication. It provides a user-friendly front-end for tournament administrators, players, and spectators. The client application includes various features and pages for easy management and participation in golf tournaments:

- Player Registration: Players can sign up, update their profiles, and view their tournament history.

- Tournament Creation: Administrators can create and manage golf tournaments, assign categories, and set up courses.

- Scorecard Tracking: Scorecards can be recorded hole-by-hole, with automatic score calculations.

- Result Analysis: The application analyzes and displays tournament results, highlighting winners in different categories.

- User Interface: The client application offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, ensuring ease of use for all users.

## How It Works

The Better Golf aplication streamlines the entire tournament management process. Here's a simplified overview of how it works:

1. **Player Registration**: Players register on the platform and provide their details.

2. **Tournament Creation**: Administrators create tournaments, specify categories, and set up courses.

3. **Scorecard Tracking**: During tournaments, scorecards are recorded, including hole scores.

4. **Result Analysis**: The application calculates and displays tournament results, identifying winners in various categories.
